## Introduction

Wordle is a word game similar to the TV show [Lingo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(British_game_show)>).

You get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter target word. After each guess, the letters light up in various colors as clues. Green means a letter is correct in this spot; yellow means a letter is _elsewhere_ in the target word; gray means a letter is not in the target word at all.

## History

In 2021, Josh "powerlanguage" Wardle created _Wordle_, a version of the Lingo word game that you can play once a day. The target word is the same for everyone each day, and you can share results to Twitter and compare with your friends. This made Wordle [go absolutely viral](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) around January 2022.

## Where are the words coming from?

We have used an online medical dictionary to generate target words. We have come up with about 190 5-letter medical words, so if you think of any others, send them our way.

From the original "hello-wordl" repository, we have continued to use the _Official Tournament and Club Word List_ used in North American Scrabble tournaments for a full dictionary of available words.
